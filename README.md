# Number Predictor

## Introduction
This project employs advanced machine learning techniques, including regression models and neural networks, to analyze brain signals captured by a specialized device. By utilizing these sophisticated models, it deciphers intricate patterns within the data, enabling precise predictions. Furthermore, it feeds these brainwave patterns into neural networks to accurately predict the number with 99.929% accuracy!
